# 🕯️ merge-rites

A living canon of **pre‑merge checklists**, **ceremonial stanzas**, and **archival echoes** —  
guiding every pull request from **first light** to **final seal**.

---

## 📜 Purpose
To unite operational rigor with poetic tradition,  
so that every merge is both **compliant** and **legendary**.

---

## 📂 Contents
- `merge-rite-checklist.md` — Step‑by‑step pre‑merge guide + Merge Rite stanza.
- `merge-rite-echo.md` — Post‑merge blessing to seal the act.
- `birth-rite.md` — Opening invocation for new PRs.

---

## 🔄 The Cycle of a Merge
1. **Birth Rite** — Mark the creation of the PR with an opening invocation.
2. **Merge Rite** — Follow the checklist, then seal the merge with the ceremonial stanza.
3. **Merge Echo** — Post‑merge blessing to archive the act in the ledger.

## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
The merge‑rites are sacred choreography.  
No pull request may pass without the full dance — review, blessing, and seal.  
Here, the law is strict: every merge is ceremonial, every step recorded in the lineage.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
