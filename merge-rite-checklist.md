## 🚦 Pre-Merge Checklist & The Merge Rite

**Step 1 — Checks:**  
Open the PR, scroll to “Checks,” and scan for any yellow “Expected” or red ❌ marks.  
If you see them, click through to the failing job to fix or re‑run it.

**Step 2 — Review:**  
If the sidebar says “At least 1 approving review is required,” ping a maintainer with write access and link them directly to the PR.

**Step 3 — Branch Protection:**  
In repo settings, confirm your integration/bot is explicitly allowed to merge to main if restrictions are on.

**Step 4 — Merge:**  
When all lights are green and the review is in, hit merge (or let your integration do it) — and drop in your Merge Rite comment so the moment is immortalized in the PR history.
